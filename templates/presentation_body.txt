Dear Sir or Madam,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Sonia Cardona and I am the founder of Profes Nómadas, a Spanish-based organisation that prepares and supports teachers through the process of entering the Irish education system.

We work closely with Spanish Early Years and Primary teachers to ensure they are fully prepared, well-trained, and registered (or in process) with the Teaching Council of Ireland. Our aim is to provide Irish schools with motivated and qualified teachers who are ready to contribute effectively to the classroom.

Please find attached a short presentation with more details about how we work and the benefits for your school. I would be delighted to arrange a call if you would like to discuss further.

Kind regards,

Sonia Cardona

Founder – Profes Nómadas
